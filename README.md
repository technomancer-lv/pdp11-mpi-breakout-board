## What's this?
This is very simple and small board that connects into PDP-11 compatible soviet made computer backplane (i.e. ДВК, Электроника-60) and gives possibility to:
- connect logic analyser directly to backplane signals
- see power supply voltage presence on LEDs.
- leave empty slot between boards because IAKI/IAKO and DMGI/DMGO signals can be looped through this board with jumper. This is the main reason why I made this project.

Board can (and most likely will) be made with ENIG coating for better contact with backplane connectors and to minimise risk of gold coated backplane contamination with Sn/Pb. All backplane signals are marked on board, so it's easier to find the right signal to be monitored with LA.

## What's the status of this project?
PCB is designed and will be sent to production soon, together with other boards.
